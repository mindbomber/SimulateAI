## Architecture

### Event Flow
```
Simulation Start → Pre-Launch Modal → Enhanced Simulation Modal → Post-Simulation Modal → Complete
```

### Component Structure
```
PostSimulationModal
├── Reflection Steps (4 guided questions)
├── Session Summary (metrics, decisions, progress)
├── Progress Visualization (step-by-step journey)
├── Learning Reinforcement (concept connections)
├── Recommendations (personalized next steps)
└── Action Buttons (Complete, Skip, Restart)
```

### Integration Pattern
```javascript
// In simulation completion handler
this.currentSimulation.on('simulation:completed', (data) => {
    this.onSimulationCompleted(data); // Shows post-simulation modal
});
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Testing the Complete Flow**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/test-complete-three-stage-flow.html
   ```

2. **Testing Individual Components**
   - Pre-Launch: Use "Test Pre-Launch Modal" button
   - Enhanced: Use "Test Enhanced Modal" button  
   - Post-Simulation: Use "Test Post-Simulation Modal" button
   - Complete Flow: Use "Test Complete Flow" button

3. **Customizing the Post-Simulation Modal**
   ```javascript
   const postModal = new PostSimulationModal(simulationId, {
       sessionData: completionData,
       onComplete: () => { /* handle completion */ },
       onSkip: () => { /* handle skip */ },
       onRestart: () => { /* handle restart */ }
   });
   ```

### For Educators

1. **Accessing Post-Simulation Insights**
   - The modal automatically appears after simulation completion
   - Provides structured reflection to reinforce learning
   - Shows decision impact analysis and concept connections
   - Offers personalized recommendations for continued learning

2. **Encouraging Student Engagement**
   - The reflection questions are designed to promote critical thinking
   - Progress visualization helps students understand their decision journey
   - Recommendations provide clear next steps for deeper exploration

## Testing

### Test Files Available

1. **`test-complete-three-stage-flow.html`** - Complete integration testing
2. **`test-post-simulation-modal.html`** - Component-specific testing
3. **`test-complete-modal-flow.html`** - End-to-end flow testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Happy Path**: Pre-launch → Simulation → Post-reflection → Complete
2. **Skip Scenarios**: User skips pre-launch or post-reflection
3. **Error Handling**: Simulation failures, modal errors, network issues
4. **Mobile Responsive**: All modals work on mobile devices
5. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## Configuration

### Modal Behavior
```javascript
// Configure reflection questions
const reflectionConfig = {
    questions: [
        { id: 'impact', text: 'How did your decisions impact different groups?' },
        { id: 'alternatives', text: 'What alternative approaches could you have taken?' },
        { id: 'learning', text: 'What was the most surprising insight?' },
        { id: 'application', text: 'How will you apply this learning?' }
    ]
};

// Configure session summary
const summaryConfig = {
    showMetrics: true,
    showDecisions: true,
    showProgress: true,
    showRecommendations: true
};
```

### Styling Customization
```css
/* Customize modal appearance */
.post-simulation-modal {
    --modal-primary-color: #667eea;
    --modal-background: #ffffff;
    --modal-border-radius: 12px;
    --modal-shadow: 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
}
```

   - Check simulationInfo data structure
   - Ensure analytics tracking is functioning

### Debug Mode
```javascript
// Enable debug logging
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
// Check browser console for detailed logs
```
