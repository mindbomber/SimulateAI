# CSS Consolidation Rollback - Complete

## 🔄 **Rollback Summary**

Successfully reverted the CSS consolidation changes and restored the original CSS file structure from git.

### ✅ **Actions Completed:**

1. **Restored Original CSS Files**
   - Used `git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/styles/` to restore all 26+ original CSS files
   - All individual CSS files are now back in place

2. **Restored Original main.css Imports**
   - Reverted main.css to use original imports:
     ```css
     @import './pre-launch-modal.css';
     @import './enhanced-simulation-modal.css';
     @import './post-simulation-modal.css';
     ```

3. **Removed Consolidated Files**
   - ❌ Deleted `consolidated-modals.css`
   - ❌ Deleted `consolidated-components.css` 
   - ❌ Deleted `consolidated-simulations.css`
   - ❌ Deleted `PHASE_2_CSS_CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE.md`

### ✅ **Current CSS File Structure (Restored):**

### ✅ **Application Status:**

- **Development Server:** Still running on localhost:3001
- **CSS Loading:** All original CSS files restored and working
- **Functionality:** Homepage and modals should now work correctly
- **Git State:** CSS files restored from previous commit, no breaking changes

### 📝 **What This Means:**

1. **Back to Working State:** The application is now using the original CSS architecture that was working before our consolidation attempt.

2. **Individual CSS Files:** Each component/feature has its own dedicated CSS file as it was originally designed.

3. **No Data Loss:** All original styling and functionality has been preserved.

4. **Clean State:** We can now proceed with other improvements or take a different approach to CSS organization if needed.

### 🚨 **Important Notes:**

- The Phase 1 cleanup (removing obsolete documentation and test files) was **kept** - only the CSS consolidation was reverted.
- The original file structure for CSS is now fully restored.
- All modal functionality, component styling, and responsive design should work as expected.
