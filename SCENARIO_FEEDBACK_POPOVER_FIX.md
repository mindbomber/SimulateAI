# Scenario Feedback Popover Fix

## Issue Resolution
**Problem**: The scenario feedback in the hero demo was not appearing as a popover despite having the correct CSS styling. The JavaScript was using `display: block` but not adding the required `.visible` class for the popover animation and positioning.

## Root Cause
The `showFeedback()` method in `src/js/components/hero-demo.js` was only setting `style.display = 'block'` but the CSS was designed to use opacity/visibility transitions with a `.visible` class for the popover effect.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated showFeedback() Method
**File**: `src/js/components/hero-demo.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
feedbackEl.style.display = 'block';
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Show popover with proper animation
feedbackEl.style.display = 'block';
feedbackEl.classList.add('visible');
```

### 2. Updated nextScenario() Method
**File**: `src/js/components/hero-demo.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
// Hide feedback
document.getElementById('demo-feedback').style.display = 'none';
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Hide feedback
const feedbackEl = document.getElementById('demo-feedback');
feedbackEl.style.display = 'none';
feedbackEl.classList.remove('visible');
```

## CSS Design (Already Correct)
The `.scenario-feedback` CSS was already properly designed for popover functionality:

- **Positioning**: Absolute positioning above choice buttons
- **Animation**: Opacity and visibility transitions with `.visible` class
- **Styling**: White background, shadow, border-radius
- **Arrow**: CSS pseudo-elements for pointing arrow
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly positioning

## Test Results
✅ **Fixed**: Popover now appears correctly as a floating element above choice buttons
✅ **Animation**: Smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions working
✅ **Positioning**: Proper absolute positioning with arrow pointing to buttons
✅ **Responsive**: Mobile layout adjustments working correctly
✅ **Interaction**: "Next Scenario" and "Try Full Simulation" buttons functional

## Files Modified
1. `src/js/components/hero-demo.js` - Added `.visible` class management
2. `test-popover-fix.html` - Created test file to verify fix

## Current Status
The scenario feedback popover is now working correctly as designed. Users can:
1. Click choice buttons to see feedback appear as a popover
2. Navigate between scenarios with proper popover hide/show
3. Complete the demo and see the final summary popover

The popover system is now fully functional and matches the intended UX design.
