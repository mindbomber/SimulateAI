# Surprise Me Button Debugging

## Issue Description

The Surprise Me button should open a new scenario that the user hasn't completed yet every time they
press it. Currently, it appears to:

1. Work correctly the first time (opens a scenario)
2. After that, only show notification toasts instead of opening new scenarios

## Debugging Steps Added

### 1. Enhanced Logging

Added comprehensive debug logging to:

- `launchRandomScenario()` - Logs when function is called and decision flow
- `getRandomUncompletedScenario()` - Logs category/scenario discovery and progress checking

### 2. Debug Functions Added

Added these global functions for testing:

- `window.clearAllProgress()` - Clears all localStorage progress
- `window.markSomeScenariosCompleted()` - Marks some scenarios as completed for testing
- `window.testSurpriseMe()` - Manually triggers Surprise Me functionality

### 3. Test Procedure

1. Open browser console
2. Run `clearAllProgress()` to reset all progress
3. Run `testSurpriseMe()` multiple times
4. Check console logs for debug information
5. Run `markSomeScenariosCompleted()` and test again

### 4. Potential Root Causes

#### A. Progress Not Being Saved Properly

- Scenario completion events might not be properly saving to localStorage
- Race condition between completion and next Surprise Me click

#### B. Progress Not Being Loaded Properly

- getRandomUncompletedScenario might be using stale data
- localStorage might be corrupted or not being read correctly

#### C. Modal State Issues

- isModalOpen flag might not be getting reset properly
- Modal cooldown might be preventing subsequent openings

#### D. CategoryGrid Reference Issues

- this.categoryGrid might become null or unavailable
- openScenarioModalDirect might fail silently

### 5. Expected Behavior

Each click of Surprise Me should:

1. Check current localStorage progress
2. Find all uncompleted scenarios
3. Select a random one
4. Open that scenario in a modal
5. After completion, mark it as completed and save to localStorage
6. Next Surprise Me click should exclude the just-completed scenario

### 6. Debug Console Commands

```javascript
// Test basic functionality
testSurpriseMe();

// Reset for testing
clearAllProgress();

// Create partial progress for testing
markSomeScenariosCompleted();

// Check current progress
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('simulateai_category_progress') || '{}');

// Check available categories and scenarios
getAllCategories().length;
getAllCategories().map(c => ({ id: c.id, scenarios: getCategoryScenarios(c.id).length }));
```

## Fix Implementation

Once root cause is identified, implement appropriate fix and test thoroughly.
