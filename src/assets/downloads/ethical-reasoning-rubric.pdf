# SimulateAI Ethical Reasoning Rubric
## Assessment Framework for AI Ethics Education

### Overview
This rubric provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating student understanding and application of ethical reasoning across all eight SimulateAI dimensions.

### How to Use This Rubric
- **Formative Assessment**: Use 2-3 dimensions per scenario
- **Summative Assessment**: Evaluate all 8 dimensions across a portfolio
- **Self-Assessment**: Encourage students to use the same criteria
- **Growth Tracking**: Monitor progress over time

### Scoring Scale
- **4 - Exceptional**: Sophisticated understanding and application
- **3 - Proficient**: Solid grasp with good application
- **2 - Developing**: Basic understanding, needs support
- **1 - Beginning**: Limited understanding, requires instruction
