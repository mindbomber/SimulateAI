# SimulateAI Portfolio Assessment Guide
## Comprehensive Framework for Tracking Student Growth

### Overview
Portfolio assessment provides a holistic view of student development in ethical reasoning over time. This guide helps educators implement meaningful portfolio systems that capture both process and growth.

### Portfolio Philosophy
Portfolios should tell the story of a student's journey in developing ethical reasoning skills. Focus on growth, reflection, and authentic demonstration of learning rather than perfect final products.
