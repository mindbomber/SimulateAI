### Using This Rubric

**For Formative Assessment:**

- Use 2-3 dimensions per scenario to avoid overwhelming students
- Focus on specific areas where students need growth
- Provide written feedback with concrete examples from their work
- Use for goal-setting and reflection conversations

**For Summative Assessment:**

- Evaluate all 8 dimensions across a portfolio of scenarios
- Include student self-assessment using the same criteria
- Weight categories based on your learning objectives
- Combine with other evidence like journals and peer evaluations

**Implementation Tips:**

1. Introduce the rubric before students start working
2. Use exemplars to illustrate each performance level
3. Encourage students to reference the rubric during their work
4. Provide regular feedback using rubric language
