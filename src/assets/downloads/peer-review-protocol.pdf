# SimulateAI Peer Review Protocol
## Structured Collaborative Learning Framework

### Purpose
Transform SimulateAI scenario discussions into meaningful peer learning experiences through structured protocols that encourage deep thinking and respectful dialogue.

### Protocol Overview
This framework provides multiple formats for peer review and collaborative analysis of ethical decision-making in SimulateAI scenarios.

---

## Format 1: Socratic Seminar Protocol

### Preparation (10 minutes)
1. **Individual Reflection**: Each student completes their scenario and fills out reflection prompts
2. **Evidence Gathering**: Students identify specific moments in their decision-making process
3. **Question Preparation**: Each student prepares one open-ended question about the scenario

### Seminar Structure (25-30 minutes)

**Opening Circle (5 minutes)**
- Teacher poses essential question: "What makes an ethical decision in this scenario?"
- Students share one-word responses around the circle

**Core Discussion (15-20 minutes)**
- Students discuss scenario decisions using evidence from their experience
- Teacher facilitates using questioning techniques:
  - "What evidence supports that perspective?"
  - "How might someone with different values respond?"
  - "What assumptions are we making here?"

**Closing Reflection (5 minutes)**
- Students write: "One insight I gained from hearing others' perspectives..."
- Volunteers share key takeaways

### Facilitation Guidelines
- **Teacher Role**: Guide, not judge; ask questions rather than provide answers
- **Student Guidelines**: Use "I" statements, ask genuine questions, build on others' ideas
- **Ground Rules**: Respect all perspectives, focus on reasoning not conclusions

## Format 2: Gallery Walk Protocol

### Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Station Creation**: Post scenario decision points around the room
2. **Materials**: Large paper, markers, sticky notes for each station
3. **Groups**: Divide students into groups of 3-4

### Rotation Process (20 minutes)

**Station Time (4 minutes each)**
- Groups analyze posted decision point
- Record their reasoning and alternative approaches
- Add questions or concerns to sticky notes

**Movement Protocol**
- Timer signals transitions between stations
- Groups rotate clockwise through all stations
- Final station: Return to original for synthesis

### Debrief (10 minutes)
- Groups report patterns they noticed across stations
- Class discusses: "What common ethical challenges emerged?"
- Individual reflection: "How did seeing others' approaches change my thinking?"

## Format 3: Collaborative Decision Trees

### Individual Phase (10 minutes)
- Students map their decision pathway through the scenario
- Include: decision points, influences, consequences considered
- Identify moments of uncertainty or value conflicts

### Pair Sharing (10 minutes)
- Students share decision trees with a partner
- Partners ask clarifying questions about decision rationale
- Look for similarities and differences in approaches

### Small Group Synthesis (15 minutes)
- Pairs combine into groups of 4-6
- Create combined decision tree showing multiple pathways
- Identify ethical frameworks that guided different approaches
- Prepare to share one insight with the whole class

### Whole Class Debrief (10 minutes)
- Groups share key insights about ethical decision-making processes
- Teacher facilitates discussion of emerging themes
- Connect to broader ethical frameworks and real-world applications

## Assessment Integration

### Peer Assessment Rubric
Students evaluate their peers on:

**Participation Quality (1-4 scale)**
- Contributes thoughtfully to discussions
- Asks probing questions that advance thinking
- Builds respectfully on others' ideas
- Shares personal insights and reasoning

**Listening Skills (1-4 scale)**
- Demonstrates active listening through responses
- Asks for clarification when needed
- References others' ideas in own contributions
- Shows openness to different perspectives

**Ethical Reasoning (1-4 scale)**
- Uses evidence from scenario to support points
- Considers multiple stakeholder perspectives
- Applies ethical frameworks appropriately
- Demonstrates growth in thinking through discussion

### Self-Assessment Questions
- "How did hearing others' perspectives change my understanding?"
- "What questions do I still have after our discussion?"
- "How can I improve my participation in future discussions?"
- "What ethical insights will I carry forward?"

## Differentiation Strategies

### For English Language Learners
- Provide sentence starters for discussion contributions
- Allow processing time before sharing
- Encourage use of visual organizers
- Pair with supportive partners

### For Shy or Reluctant Participants
- Start with written responses before verbal sharing
- Use think-pair-share before larger group discussions
- Provide specific roles (timekeeper, note-taker, reporter)
- Offer alternative ways to contribute (drawings, diagrams)

### For Advanced Learners
- Assign facilitation roles within small groups
- Encourage connections to broader philosophical frameworks
- Challenge to identify unstated assumptions
- Invite to prepare additional discussion questions

---

## Extension Activities

### Digital Collaboration
- Use online discussion boards for asynchronous peer review
- Create collaborative documents for ongoing scenario analysis
- Record video responses for peers to review and respond
- Use polling tools to gather class perspectives on ethical dilemmas

### Community Connections
- Invite community members to participate in discussions
- Connect scenario decisions to local ethical issues
- Research how different cultures might approach the same dilemmas
- Interview family members about their ethical decision-making processes
