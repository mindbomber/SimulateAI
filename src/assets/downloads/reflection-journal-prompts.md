# SimulateAI Reflection Journal Prompts

## Scaffolded Questions for Deep Learning

### Purpose

These prompts guide students through metacognitive reflection after completing SimulateAI scenarios.
Use them to deepen understanding, encourage critical thinking, and help students connect ethical
reasoning to their lived experiences.

### How to Use These Prompts

**For Individual Reflection:**

- Choose 2-3 prompts per scenario
- Allow 10-15 minutes for written reflection
- Encourage honest, thoughtful responses
- No "right" answers—focus on reasoning process

**For Discussion:**

- Use prompts as conversation starters
- Pair students to share responses
- Build toward whole-class synthesis
- Honor diverse perspectives and experiences

**For Portfolio Development:**

- Select strongest reflections for portfolio inclusion
- Track growth over time using similar prompts
- Include student self-assessment of progress
- Connect to learning goals and standards

## Core Reflection Prompts

### Immediate Response (Use after each scenario)

**Prompt 1: Initial Reaction** "In one sentence, describe your immediate gut reaction to this
scenario. What was your first instinct, and why do you think you felt that way?"

**Prompt 2: Stakeholder Perspective** "Which stakeholder in this scenario do you most identify with?
Which stakeholder's perspective is hardest for you to understand? Explain why."

**Prompt 3: Real-World Connection** "Have you encountered a similar ethical dilemma in your own
life, your community, or in current events? How does this scenario connect to your lived
experience?"

### Decision Analysis (Use to examine reasoning process)

**Prompt 4: Values Conflict** "Which ethical dimensions pulled you in different directions? Describe
a moment when you had to choose between two values you care about."

**Prompt 5: Decision Evolution** "How did your decision change as you worked through the scenario?
What new information or perspective shifted your thinking?"

**Prompt 6: Alternative Paths** "If you could go back and make different choices, what would you do
differently? What might be the consequences of that alternative path?"

### Radar Chart Reflection (Use with visual analysis)

**Prompt 7: Pattern Recognition** "Look at your radar chart. Which dimensions scored highest and
lowest? What does this pattern tell you about your ethical priorities?"

**Prompt 8: Comparison Analysis** "Compare your radar chart with a classmate's (if appropriate).
What similarities and differences do you notice? What might explain these patterns?"

**Prompt 9: Growth Areas** "Based on your radar chart, which ethical dimension would you like to
strengthen? What would it look like to score higher in that area?"

### Broader Implications (Use for synthesis and transfer)

**Prompt 10: Systemic Thinking** "This scenario shows one ethical dilemma, but it's part of larger
systems and structures. What bigger issues or patterns does this scenario reveal?"

**Prompt 11: Future Implications** "Imagine this scenario playing out 10 years from now. How might
technology, society, or values have evolved? What new ethical challenges might emerge?"

**Prompt 12: Personal Agency** "As a young person who will inherit these technological systems, what
role do you want to play in shaping more ethical outcomes?"

### Metacognitive Reflection (Use for learning about learning)

**Prompt 13: Learning Process** "What did this scenario teach you about how you approach ethical
decisions? What thinking strategies did you use?"

**Prompt 14: Challenge Points** "What part of this scenario was most difficult or confusing? How did
you work through that challenge?"

**Prompt 15: Application Planning** "How will you apply what you learned from this scenario to
future ethical decisions in your own life?"

## Differentiated Prompts by Learning Level

### For Beginning Ethical Reasoners

**Simplified Language Prompts:**

- "What felt right or wrong in this scenario? Why?"
- "Who might be helped or hurt by these decisions?"
- "What would you want someone to do if you were in this situation?"
- "How does this connect to rules or values you learned at home or school?"

### For Advanced Ethical Reasoners

**Complex Analysis Prompts:**

- "How do cultural, historical, and economic contexts shape the ethical landscape of this scenario?"
- "What philosophical frameworks (utilitarian, deontological, virtue ethics, care ethics) best apply
  here?"
- "How might different stakeholders define 'harm' and 'benefit' differently in this context?"
- "What are the second and third-order consequences of the decisions made in this scenario?"

### For English Language Learners

**Scaffolded Language Prompts:**

- Provide sentence starters: "I think **\_** because **\_**"
- Use visual organizers with prompt questions
- Allow drawing/diagramming as part of response
- Encourage responses in first language with English summary
