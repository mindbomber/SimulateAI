## Core Reflection Prompts

### Immediate Response (Use after each scenario)

**Prompt 1: Initial Reaction**
"In one sentence, describe your immediate gut reaction to this scenario. What was your first instinct, and why do you think you felt that way?"

**Prompt 2: Stakeholder Perspective** 
"Which stakeholder in this scenario do you most identify with? Which stakeholder's perspective is hardest for you to understand? Explain why."

**Prompt 3: Real-World Connection**
"Have you encountered a similar ethical dilemma in your own life, your community, or in current events? How does this scenario connect to your lived experience?"

### Decision Analysis (Use to examine reasoning process)

**Prompt 4: Values Conflict**
"Which ethical dimensions pulled you in different directions? Describe a moment when you had to choose between two values you care about."

**Prompt 5: Decision Evolution**
"How did your decision change as you worked through the scenario? What new information or perspective shifted your thinking?"

**Prompt 6: Alternative Paths**
"If you could go back and make different choices, what would you do differently? What might be the consequences of that alternative path?"

### Radar Chart Reflection (Use with visual analysis)

**Prompt 7: Pattern Recognition**
"Look at your radar chart. Which dimensions scored highest and lowest? What does this pattern tell you about your ethical priorities?"

**Prompt 8: Comparison Analysis**
"Compare your radar chart with a classmate's. What similarities and differences do you notice? What might explain these patterns?"

**Prompt 9: Growth Areas**
"Based on your radar chart, which ethical dimension would you like to strengthen? What would it look like to score higher in that area?"

### Broader Implications (Use for synthesis and transfer)

**Prompt 10: Systemic Thinking**
"This scenario shows one ethical dilemma, but it's part of larger systems. What bigger issues or patterns does this scenario reveal?"

**Prompt 11: Future Implications**
"Imagine this scenario playing out 10 years from now. How might technology, society, or values have evolved? What new challenges might emerge?"

**Prompt 12: Personal Agency**
"As a young person who will inherit these technological systems, what role do you want to play in shaping more ethical outcomes?"

### Metacognitive Reflection (Use for learning about learning)

**Prompt 13: Learning Process**
"What did this scenario teach you about how you approach ethical decisions? What thinking strategies did you use?"

**Prompt 14: Challenge Points**
"What part of this scenario was most difficult or confusing? How did you work through that challenge?"

**Prompt 15: Application Planning**
"How will you apply what you learned from this scenario to future ethical decisions in your own life?"
