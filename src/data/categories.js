/**
 * Category Data Structure for Ethical Dilemma Categories
 *
 * HIERARCHY CLARIFICATION:
 * - CATEGORY: A thematic group of related ethical scenarios (e.g., "The Trolley Problem")
 * - SCENARIO: Individual ethical dilemmas within a category (e.g., "Autonomous Vehicle Split Decision")
 * - SIMULATION: The interactive experience where users engage with scenarios
 *
 * Each category contains 3 scenarios with ethical decision points.
 * Each scenario becomes an interactive simulation when launched.
