- **Tree shaking potential**: Individual modules enable better optimization
- **Code splitting opportunities**: Components can be loaded on demand
- **Caching benefits**: Changes to one module don't invalidate others

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### **ColorPicker Extraction Plan**

1. **Create `color-picker.js`** with full implementation (~1,450 lines)
2. **Import shared modules** (constants, theme, canvas utilities)
3. **Test canvas rendering** functionality
4. **Verify accessibility features** work correctly
5. **Update original file** to remove extracted code
6. **Test application functionality** end-to-end

### **Risk Mitigation Strategy**
