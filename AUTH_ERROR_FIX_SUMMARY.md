# Authentication Error Fix Summary 🔧

## 🐛 Issue Identified

The console error was:

```
Uncaught TypeError: this.showAuthModal is not a function
    at HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous> (auth-service.js:933:54)
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

Method name mismatch - the code was calling `showAuthModal()` but the actual method is named
`showLoginModal()`.

## ✅ Files Fixed

### 1. `src/js/services/auth-service.js`

**Line 933:** Fixed method call in `updateAuthenticationUI()`

```javascript
// Before (ERROR):
signInBtn.addEventListener('click', () => this.showAuthModal());

// After (FIXED):
signInBtn.addEventListener('click', () => this.showLoginModal());
```

### 2. `src/js/components/intentional-logout-manager.js`

**Line 238:** Fixed method call in logout modal reauthentication

```javascript
// Before (ERROR):
this.authService?.showAuthModal?.();

// After (FIXED):
this.authService?.showLoginModal?.();
```

### 3. Additional Lint Fixes in `auth-service.js`

- Removed console statements that were flagged by linter
- Fixed magic number issue by defining `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH = 6` constant

## 🎯 Result

- ✅ Sign-in modal should now work correctly when clicking "Sign In" buttons
- ✅ Reauthentication after intentional logout will work properly
- ✅ No more `showAuthModal is not a function` errors
- ✅ Lint errors resolved

## 🧪 Testing

You can now test the fix by:

1. Opening `http://localhost:3001/` in your browser
2. Clicking any "Sign In" button
3. The authentication modal should open without errors
