# MODAL VISIBILITY ROOT CAUSE FIX

## Issue Summary
**Critical Bug**: Simulation modals were invisible due to missing `.visible` class that controls CSS opacity.

## Root Cause Identified
The modal backdrop CSS works as follows:
```css
.modal-backdrop {
    opacity: 0;  /* Hidden by default */
    /* ... */
}

.modal-backdrop.visible {
    opacity: 1;  /* Visible when .visible class is added */
}
```

However, the simulation modal in `app.js` was only setting:
```javascript
this.modal.style.display = 'flex';  // Shows the modal
```

But **not adding the `.visible` class**, so the modal remained at `opacity: 0` (invisible).

## User Discovery
User identified this by unchecking the opacity property in browser dev tools, which revealed the hidden modal content. This was the key insight that led to discovering the `.visible` class requirement.

## Fix Applied
**File**: `src/js/app.js`

### Show Modal Method (~line 1237)
**Before:**
```javascript
this.modal.style.display = 'flex';
```

**After:**
```javascript
this.modal.style.display = 'flex';

// Add visible class for CSS opacity transition
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    this.modal.classList.add('visible');
});
```

### Close Modal Method (~line 1325)
**Before:**
```javascript
this.modal.style.display = 'none';
```

**After:**
```javascript
this.modal.classList.remove('visible');
this.modal.style.display = 'none';
```

## Why This Fix Works
1. **Display Control**: `style.display = 'flex'` makes the modal take up space and become interactive
2. **Visibility Control**: `.visible` class sets `opacity: 1` making the modal actually visible to users
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Using `requestAnimationFrame` ensures the opacity transition can animate properly
4. **Proper Cleanup**: Removing `.visible` class on close prevents state issues on subsequent opens

## Testing
Created `test-modal-visible-class-fix.html` to verify:
- Manual modal control with proper `.visible` class management
- Simulation modal using the fixed app.js method
- Opacity verification and visual confirmation

## Impact
This fix resolves the core visibility issue affecting:
- ✅ Pre-launch modals
- ✅ Simulation content modals  
- ✅ Post-simulation modals
- ✅ All modal dialogs using the main simulation modal element

- [x] Clean close behavior maintained

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Modal visibility root cause fixed
