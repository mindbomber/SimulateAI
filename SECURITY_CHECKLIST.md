# 🔐 Pre-Commit Security Checklist

## ✅ SECURITY STATUS: READY FOR GITHUB

### 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented

#### ✅ Environment Variables Secured

- [x] `.env` file created with actual API keys
- [x] `.env.example` created with placeholder values
- [x] `.gitignore` updated to exclude `.env` files
- [x] Git properly ignoring `.env` file (verified)

#### ✅ Code Updated for Security

- [x] `enhanced-donation-widget.js` - Uses environment variables
- [x] `firebase-service.js` - Uses environment config utility
- [x] `donate.html` - Updated to use env vars with fallbacks
- [x] Environment config utility created (`src/js/utils/env-config.js`)

#### ✅ Documentation Sanitized

- [x] `FIREBASE_STRIPE_SETUP.md` - Removed actual API keys
- [x] `SECURITY_GUIDE.md` - Created comprehensive security guide
- [x] `DONOR_FLAIR_SYSTEM.md` - Updated with security considerations

#### ✅ Git Configuration

- [x] `.gitignore` includes environment variable protection
- [x] `.env` file is ignored by git
- [x] No sensitive data in tracked files

### 🔍 Files Checked for Sensitive Data

#### ✅ Clean Files (Safe to Commit):

- `.env.example` - Contains only placeholders
- `src/js/utils/env-config.js` - Environment utility (no secrets)
- `src/js/components/enhanced-donation-widget.js` - Uses env vars
- `src/js/services/firebase-service.js` - Uses env config
- `docs/SECURITY_GUIDE.md` - Security documentation
- `docs/FIREBASE_STRIPE_SETUP.md` - Sanitized setup guide

#### 🔒 Protected Files (Not Committed):

- `.env` - Contains actual API keys (properly ignored)

### 🚀 Ready for Deployment

#### Production Deployment:

1. Set environment variables in your hosting platform
2. Use the environment config utility
3. Monitor for any hardcoded keys in production

#### Development Setup:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your development API keys
3. Never commit the actual `.env` file

### 🆘 Emergency Procedures

If sensitive data is accidentally committed:

1. Immediately rotate all exposed API keys
2. Update Firebase Functions configuration
3. Review git history and clean if necessary
4. Monitor for unauthorized usage

## 🎯 RESULT: CODEBASE IS SECURE FOR GITHUB UPLOAD

All sensitive API keys and secrets have been:

- Moved to environment variables
- Protected by .gitignore
- Replaced with secure loading mechanisms
- Documented with security best practices

**This codebase is now safe to upload to GitHub! 🚀**
