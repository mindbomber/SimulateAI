# TAB CONTENT VISIBILITY LOGIC FIX

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: Tab content was hidden by default when it should be visible, requiring manual unchecking of `display: none` in dev tools to see content.

## Root Cause Analysis
The initial CSS approach was **backwards**:

### Wrong Logic (Previous Fix)
```css
/* WRONG - Hides everything by default */
.tab-content {
  display: none;
}

.tab-content.active {
  display: block; /* Only shows when .active class is present */
}
```

### Correct Logic (Current Fix)
```css
/* CORRECT - Shows everything by default */
.tab-content {
  display: block; /* Show by default */
}

.tab-content:not(.active) {
  display: none; /* Only hide non-active tabs */
}
```

## User Feedback Analysis
When user had to **uncheck** `display: none` in dev tools to make content visible, this indicated:
- ✅ Content should be visible by default
- ❌ CSS was incorrectly hiding content that should be shown
- ✅ The `.active` class logic was working, but the base state was wrong

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Bias Fairness CSS
**File**: `src/styles/bias-fairness.css`

**Fixed Logic:**
```css
/* Show by default, hide only non-active */
.bias-simulation-container .tab-content {
  display: block; /* Show by default */
}

.bias-simulation-container .tab-content:not(.active) {
  display: none; /* Only hide non-active tabs */
}
```

### 2. Pre-Launch Modal CSS
**File**: `src/styles/pre-launch-modal.css`

**Fixed Logic:**
```css
/* Show by default, hide only non-active */
.pre-launch-modal .tab-content {
  display: block !important; /* Show by default */
}

.pre-launch-modal .tab-content:not(.active) {
  display: none !important; /* Only hide non-active tabs */
}
```

## Why This Approach Works

### CSS Selector Logic
1. **Base State**: `display: block` - All tab content is visible by default
2. **Hide Inactive**: `:not(.active)` - Only tabs WITHOUT the `.active` class are hidden
3. **Show Active**: Active tabs remain visible because they don't match the `:not(.active)` selector

### JavaScript Compatibility
- When JavaScript adds `.active` class → Tab becomes visible automatically
- When JavaScript removes `.active` class → Tab gets hidden by `:not(.active)` rule
- No dependency on JavaScript timing or class management order

### Progressive Enhancement
- Even if JavaScript fails, at least one tab (with `.active` class in HTML) will be visible
- Graceful degradation for users with JavaScript disabled

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Tab content hidden by default (display: none)
- ❌ Required `.active` class to show content
- ❌ User had to manually uncheck display: none in dev tools

### After Fix
- ✅ Tab content visible by default (display: block)
- ✅ Only non-active tabs are hidden
- ✅ Active tabs show without requiring manual intervention

## Verification
Updated test page: `test-tab-content-modal-footer.html`
- ✅ Pre-launch modal tabs now show correctly
- ✅ Bias fairness tabs work as expected
- ✅ No manual dev tools intervention required

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Tab content now visible by default with correct hide/show logic
