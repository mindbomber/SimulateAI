# Navigation Accessibility Fix

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing an accessibility warning:
```
Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. 
The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users. 
Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor. 
Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus.
```

This error occurred when navigation links were clicked and the navigation was being hidden while a descendant element (the clicked link) still had focus.

## Root Cause
The issue was happening in several navigation event handlers where `aria-hidden="true"` was being set on the navigation element while a focused element (like a clicked navigation link) was still inside it. This creates an accessibility violation because screen readers lose track of the focused element.

## Solution Implemented
Added proper focus management to all navigation-related event handlers by:

1. **Moving focus away from clicked elements before hiding navigation**
2. **Using setTimeout to ensure focus moves before aria-hidden is set**
3. **Providing fallback focus targets (nav toggle button or document body)**

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/js/app.js`

#### Navigation Link Click Handlers (lines ~2100-2200)
- Added `moveFocusAndCloseNav()` helper function
- Moves focus to nav toggle button before closing navigation
- Uses setTimeout to ensure proper timing

#### Take Tour Button Handler (lines ~920-950)
- Updated to use correct navigation class names (`main-nav` instead of `nav`)
- Added focus management before closing navigation
- Fixed inconsistent navigation state management

#### Mega Menu Item Handlers (lines ~2370-2390 and ~2440-2460)
- Added focus management for mobile navigation closure
- Moves focus to nav toggle before setting `aria-hidden="true"`

### 2. Existing Good Practice in `src/js/category-page.js`
The category page already had proper focus management implemented, which served as a reference for the main application fixes.

## Implementation Details

### Focus Management Pattern
```javascript
// Move focus away from the clicked link before closing navigation
const moveFocusAndCloseNav = () => {
  // Move focus to a safe element (nav toggle button or document body)
  if (navToggle) {
    navToggle.focus();
  } else {
    document.body.focus();
  }
  
  // Close navigation after focus has moved
  setTimeout(() => toggleNav(false), 0);
};
```

### Key Changes
1. **Regular Navigation Links**: Added focus management before calling `toggleNav(false)`
2. **Take Tour Button**: Fixed class names and added proper focus management
3. **Mega Menu Items**: Added focus management for mobile navigation closure
4. **View All Link**: Added focus management for mobile navigation closure

## Testing
- ESLint passed with 0 errors (only magic number warnings remain)
- Navigation accessibility warning should no longer appear
- Focus properly moves to nav toggle button when navigation is closed
- Screen readers maintain focus tracking throughout navigation

## Best Practices Applied
1. **Always move focus before setting `aria-hidden="true"`**
2. **Use setTimeout to ensure focus moves before DOM changes**
3. **Provide reliable focus targets (nav toggle or document body)**
4. **Maintain consistent navigation state management**

## Browser Compatibility
This fix uses standard focus management and setTimeout, which are well-supported across all modern browsers.

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing `inert` attribute as suggested by the warning (when browser support improves)
- Monitor for similar accessibility issues in other modal or overlay components
- Regular accessibility auditing to catch such issues early
