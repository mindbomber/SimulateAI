# Canvas Theme Bug Fix

## Issue Description
The canvas renderer was failing to initialize due to a `TypeError: this.options.theme.toUpperCase is not a function` error. This was happening because the canvas manager was passing a theme object instead of a theme string to the CanvasRenderer.

## Root Cause
The `CanvasTheme.getCurrentTheme()` method returns an object with this structure:
```javascript
{
    highContrast: boolean,
    darkMode: boolean,
    reducedMotion: boolean,
    theme: string  // 'light', 'dark', or 'highContrast'
}
```

However, the code was passing the entire theme object to the CanvasRenderer constructor and other methods, when it should have been passing only the `theme` string property.

## Files Fixed
1. **src/js/renderers/canvas-renderer.js**
   - Fixed constructor to safely handle theme parameter with type checking
   - Fixed `setTheme()` method to safely handle theme parameter

2. **src/js/utils/canvas-manager.js**
   - Fixed `createVisualEngine()` to pass `this.theme.theme` instead of `this.theme`
   - Fixed `setTheme()` call to pass theme string
   - Fixed `updateAllCanvasThemes()` to pass theme string to engine updates

## Solution
Added proper type checking and ensured that only the theme string (from the `theme` property) is passed to methods expecting a string parameter.

### Before:
```javascript
this.currentTheme = CANVAS_CONSTANTS.THEMES[this.options.theme.toUpperCase()] || CANVAS_CONSTANTS.THEMES.LIGHT;
```

### After:
```javascript
const themeKey = (typeof this.options.theme === 'string' ? this.options.theme : 'light').toUpperCase();
this.currentTheme = CANVAS_CONSTANTS.THEMES[themeKey] || CANVAS_CONSTANTS.THEMES.LIGHT;
```

## Testing
- Development server starts without errors
- Canvas renderer initializes successfully
- Interactive buttons and visual engine creation works properly
- Theme system works correctly with proper fallbacks

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - The `TypeError: this.options.theme.toUpperCase is not a function` error has been fixed and canvas rendering now works properly.
