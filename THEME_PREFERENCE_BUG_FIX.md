# Theme Preference Bug Fix

## Problem Identified
There was a critical bug in the theme monitoring system where system theme changes would overwrite user-set preferences in the application.

## Root Cause
In the `setupThemeMonitoring()` method, when system preferences changed (e.g., user changes OS dark mode), the code was:

1. **Incorrectly overwriting all preferences** with new system values
2. **Losing user's explicit app choices** when system theme changed
3. **Not distinguishing** between system defaults and user-set preferences

## The Bug Scenario
1. User opens app → System is in light mode → App uses light mode
2. User manually clicks dark mode toggle → App switches to dark mode, saves preference
3. User later changes OS to dark mode → System theme change event fires
4. **Bug**: App overwrites user's saved dark mode preference with new system preference
5. Result: User's explicit choice is lost and behavior becomes unpredictable

## Solution Implemented
Updated `setupThemeMonitoring()` to:

1. **Check saved preferences first** before updating any theme values
2. **Only update preferences that haven't been explicitly set by user**
3. **Preserve user choices** regardless of system theme changes
4. **Maintain proper separation** between system defaults and user overrides

## Code Changes
- Modified `handleThemeChange()` function in `setupThemeMonitoring()`
- Now checks `userPreferences.getAccessibilitySettings()` to see which preferences are user-set
- Only updates system-based preferences when `savedPreferences[setting] === undefined`
- Preserves user choices when they exist

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- **Initial load**: Uses system preferences as defaults (unchanged)
- **User toggles**: Saves user preference and respects it (unchanged)
- **System changes**: Only affects preferences user hasn't explicitly set (fixed)
- **User preference persistence**: User choices are never overwritten by system changes (fixed)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Open app with system in light mode → should show light theme
2. Toggle dark mode in app → should switch to dark and stay dark
3. Change OS to dark mode → app should stay in user's chosen dark mode
4. Toggle dark mode off in app → should switch to light
5. Change OS back to light mode → app should stay in user's chosen light mode

This fix ensures user preferences always take precedence over system defaults once set.
