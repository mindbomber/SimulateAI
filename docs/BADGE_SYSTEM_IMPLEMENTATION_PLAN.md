# 🏆 Badge System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive badge system that rewards users for completing scenarios within each ethical category. The system will feature animated badge reveal modals with confetti effects, progress tracking, and scalable architecture for future expansion.

## 🎯 Core Requirements

### Badge Structure
- **3 Badge Tiers per Category**: 1, 3, and 6 scenarios completed
- **Future Scalability**: Triangular progression spacing (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21...)
- **Visual Identity**: 🛡️ shield with category emoji + badge-specific sidekick emoji
- **Glow Intensity**: Increases with badge tier

### Badge Components
1. **Confetti Animation**: Category emoji particles using js-confetti
2. **Badge Modal**: Animated reveal with shield, emojis, and text
3. **Progress Tracking**: localStorage-based completion tracking
4. **Dynamic Calculation**: Real-time badge eligibility checking

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Badge Data Structure
```javascript
{
  categoryId: {
    badges: {
      tier1: { unlocked: true, timestamp: 1234567890 },
      tier2: { unlocked: false, timestamp: null },
      tier3: { unlocked: false, timestamp: null }
    },
    completedScenarios: ['scenario1', 'scenario2'],
    progress: {
      completed: 2,
      total: 9
    }
  }
}
```

### Badge Configuration Schema
```javascript
{
  tier: 1,
  requirement: 1,
  title: "Ethics Explorer",
  sidekickEmoji: "⚖️",
  quote: "Every choice denies another. You chose—and the universe responded.",
  glowIntensity: "low"
}
```
