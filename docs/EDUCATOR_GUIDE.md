# Educator Guide - SimulateAI in the Classroom

## üéì Welcome to AI Ethics Education

SimulateAI brings the proven digital science laboratory approach to AI ethics education, inspired by PhET Interactive Simulations from the University of Colorado Boulder. Our platform empowers educators to guide students through open-ended exploration of complex AI challenges with real-world relevance.

## üåü Educational Philosophy

### No "Correct" Answers, Maximum Learning
Unlike traditional educational software, SimulateAI simulations have no predetermined correct outcomes. Instead, students:

- **Explore Consequences**: See immediate effects of their decisions in realistic scenarios
- **Develop Critical Thinking**: Analyze complex trade-offs and multiple perspectives  
- **Build Ethical Reasoning**: Form frameworks for evaluating AI impacts on society
- **Practice Systems Thinking**: Understand interconnections between technology and human values

### Research-Based Pedagogical Approach
Our design follows evidence-based educational principles:

- **Active Learning**: Students learn by doing, not just observing
- **Constructivist Discovery**: Knowledge builds through guided exploration
- **Social Learning**: Collaborative discussion and reflection enhance understanding
- **Authentic Assessment**: Open-ended evaluation matches real-world complexity

## üéØ ISTE Standards Alignment

SimulateAI is designed to support the ISTE Standards for Students and Educators:

### ISTE Standards for Students
- **Empowered Learner**: Students leverage technology to take ownership of learning goals
