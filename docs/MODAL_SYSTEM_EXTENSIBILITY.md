# Modal System Modularity & Extensibility Assessment

## Executive Summary

The SimulateAI platform features a **highly modular and extensible modal system** that makes creating new scenarios and learning labs straightforward. The architecture follows clean separation of concerns with reusable components, standardized data structures, and flexible configuration options.

**Bottom Line: Creating new scenarios and learning labs is easy and well-structured.**

---

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **`ModalUtility`** - Base modal framework with consistent behavior
2. **`PreLaunchModal`** - Learning lab modal for educational context
3. **`ScenarioModal`** - Interactive scenario presentation with radar charts
4. **`ScenarioDataManager`** - Dynamic data loading and caching

### Data Structure Hierarchy

```
CATEGORY â†’ SCENARIO â†’ SIMULATION
â”œâ”€â”€ Category (thematic group, e.g., "The Trolley Problem")
â”œâ”€â”€ Scenario (individual dilemma, e.g., "Autonomous Vehicle Split Decision")
â””â”€â”€ Simulation (interactive experience with the scenario)
```

---

## Modular Design Strengths

### 1. Reusable Base Infrastructure

**`ModalUtility` provides:**
- Consistent modal behavior (open/close, backdrop, keyboard navigation)
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, focus management, inert states)
- Responsive design support
- Event handling standardization

**Benefits:**
- All modals behave consistently
- Accessibility is built-in
- Minimal boilerplate for new modal types

### 2. Standardized Data Structures

**Categories are defined in `src/data/categories.js`:**
```javascript
{
  id: 'category-name',
  title: 'Display Name',
  description: 'Category description',
  icon: 'ðŸšƒ',
  scenarios: [
    {
      id: 'scenario-id',
      title: 'Scenario Title',
      description: 'Scenario description',
      difficulty: 'beginner|intermediate|advanced'
    }
  ],
  learningObjectives: [...],
  tags: [...]
}
```

**Scenarios are stored in `src/js/data/scenarios/[category]-scenarios.js`:**
```javascript
{
  'scenario-id': {
    title: 'Scenario Title',
    dilemma: 'The main ethical dilemma description',
    ethicalQuestion: 'Central question to consider',
    options: [
      {
        id: 'option-a',
        text: 'Option name',
        description: 'Detailed description',
        impact: { fairness: +1, autonomy: -1, ... },
        pros: [...],
        cons: [...]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Flexible Content Generation

**`PreLaunchModal` automatically generates:**
- Overview tab with scenario briefing
- Learning objectives aligned with ISTE standards
- Ethics guide with vocabulary and concepts
- Preparation tips and resource links
- Educator resources (when enabled)

**Configuration options:**
```javascript
const modal = new PreLaunchModal(simulationId, {
  onLaunch: () => { /* launch simulation */ },
  onCancel: () => { /* cancel action */ },
  showEducatorResources: true,
  categoryData: categoryInfo,
  scenarioData: scenarioInfo
});
```

## Creating New Scenarios: Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Add Category Definition

**File:** `src/data/categories.js`

```javascript
'new-category': {
  id: 'new-category',
  title: 'New Ethical Category',
  description: 'Description of the ethical themes',
  icon: 'ðŸŽ¯',
  difficulty: 'beginner',
  estimatedTime: 15,
  color: '#3498db',
  scenarios: [
    {
      id: 'first-scenario',
      title: 'First Scenario Title',
      description: 'Brief scenario description',
      difficulty: 'beginner'
    }
    // Add 2-3 scenarios per category
  ],
  learningObjectives: [
    'Objective 1',
    'Objective 2'
  ],
  tags: ['ethics', 'relevant-tags']
}
```

### Step 2: Create Scenario Data File

**File:** `src/js/data/scenarios/new-category-scenarios.js`

```javascript
export default {
  'first-scenario': {
    title: 'First Scenario Title',
    dilemma: 'Detailed description of the ethical dilemma...',
    ethicalQuestion: 'What is the central ethical question?',
    options: [
      {
        id: 'option-a',
        text: 'First Option',
        description: 'Detailed explanation of this choice',
        impact: {
          fairness: +1,        // -2 to +2 scale
          sustainability: 0,
          autonomy: -1,
          beneficence: +2,
          transparency: +1,
          accountability: 0,
          privacy: +1,
          proportionality: -1
        },
        pros: [
          'Positive aspect 1',
          'Positive aspect 2'
        ],
        cons: [
          'Negative consequence 1',
          'Potential problem'
        ]
      },
      {
        id: 'option-b',
        text: 'Second Option',
        // ... similar structure
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Register Scenario Data

**File:** `src/js/data/scenario-data-manager.js`

Add import and registration:
```javascript
import newCategoryScenarios from './scenarios/new-category-scenarios.js';

// Add to SCENARIO_MODULES
const SCENARIO_MODULES = {
  'new-category': () => newCategoryScenarios,
  // ... existing categories
};
```

### Step 4: Add Learning Lab Information (Optional)

**File:** `src/js/data/simulation-info.js`

```javascript
export const SIMULATION_INFO = {
  'new-scenario-id': {
    id: 'new-scenario-id',
    title: 'Scenario Display Title',
    subtitle: 'Brief subtitle',
    learningObjectives: [...],
    isteCriteria: [...],
    duration: '15-20 minutes',
    difficulty: 'beginner',
    recommendedAge: '13+',
    beforeYouStart: {
      briefing: 'Pre-launch educational context...',
      vocabulary: [...],
      preparationTips: [...],
      scenarioOverview: 'What students will experience'
    },
    educatorResources: {
      discussionQuestions: [...],
      assessmentRubric: {...}
    }
  }
};
```

## Creating New Scenarios in Existing Categories

Adding scenarios to existing categories is **even easier** than creating new categories since the infrastructure is already in place. You only need to add scenario data and optionally create learning lab content.

### Step 1: Add Scenario to Category Definition

**File:** `src/data/categories.js`

Find the existing category and add your scenario to its `scenarios` array:

```javascript
'trolley-problem': {
  // ...existing category properties...
  scenarios: [
    // ...existing scenarios...
    {
      id: 'new-trolley-scenario',
      title: 'AI Emergency Response Dilemma',
      description: 'An AI emergency dispatch system must prioritize between multiple simultaneous crises with limited resources.',
      difficulty: 'intermediate'
    }
  ],
  // ...rest of category...
}
```

### Step 2: Add Scenario Data to Existing File

**File:** `src/js/data/scenarios/[category]-scenarios.js`

Add your new scenario to the existing scenario file:

```javascript
export default {
  // ...existing scenarios...
  
  'new-trolley-scenario': {
    title: 'AI Emergency Response Dilemma',
    dilemma: 'An AI-powered emergency dispatch system receives simultaneous calls: a cardiac arrest at a nursing home, a multi-car accident on the highway, and a house fire with trapped children. Only two ambulances are available, and response time will determine survival rates.',
    ethicalQuestion: 'How should an AI system prioritize emergency responses when every second counts and lives hang in the balance?',
    options: [
      {
        id: 'option-a',
        text: 'Prioritize by Statistical Survival Rates',
        description: 'Send resources based on AI calculations of highest probability of saving the most lives.',
        impact: {
          fairness: -1,
          sustainability: +1,
          autonomy: +2,
          beneficence: +2,
          transparency: +1,
          accountability: 0,
          privacy: 0,
          proportionality: +1
        },
        pros: [
          'Maximizes total lives saved based on data',
          'Removes emotional bias from critical decisions',
          'Consistent application of objective criteria'
        ],
        cons: [
          'May systematically disadvantage certain demographics',
          'Ignores individual circumstances not captured in data',
          'Could feel cold and impersonal to affected families'
        ]
      },
      {
        id: 'option-b',
        text: 'First-Come, First-Served Approach',
        description: 'Dispatch resources in the order that emergency calls were received.',
        impact: {
          fairness: +2,
          sustainability: -1,
          autonomy: -1,
          beneficence: -1,
          transparency: +2,
          accountability: +1,
          privacy: 0,
          proportionality: 0
        },
        pros: [
          'Treats all emergencies equally regardless of demographics',
          'Simple, transparent, and easy to understand system',
          'Prevents discrimination based on AI bias'
        ],
        cons: [
          'May result in more preventable deaths overall',
          'Ignores severity and urgency differences',
          'Wastes AI capabilities for optimization'
        ]
      },
      {
        id: 'option-c',
        text: 'Hybrid Human-AI Decision Making',
        description: 'AI provides recommendations but human dispatchers make final decisions with override capability.',
        impact: {
          fairness: +1,
          sustainability: 0,
          autonomy: 0,
          beneficence: +1,
          transparency: +1,
          accountability: +2,
          privacy: 0,
          proportionality: +1
        },
        pros: [
          'Combines AI efficiency with human judgment',
          'Allows for context that AI might miss',
          'Maintains human responsibility and accountability'
        ],
        cons: [
          'Slower decision-making in critical moments',
          'Inconsistent application depending on dispatcher',
          'May introduce human biases and errors'
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Create Learning Lab Content (Optional)

**File:** `src/js/data/simulation-info.js`

Add educational context for your new scenario:

```javascript
export const SIMULATION_INFO = {
  // ...existing scenarios...
  
  'new-trolley-scenario': {
    id: 'new-trolley-scenario',

        'Debate the ethics of using AI in life-and-death situations'
      ]
    }
  }
};
```

### Step 4: That's It! ðŸŽ‰

Your new scenario is now:
- âœ… Automatically available in the category grid
- âœ… Accessible through navigation menus
- âœ… Integrated with the modal system
- âœ… Ready with learning lab content (if you added it)
- âœ… Compatible with all existing features (radar charts, accessibility, etc.)

### Key Benefits of Adding to Existing Categories:

1. **No Infrastructure Setup** - Category colors, icons, navigation already exist
2. **Automatic Integration** - Scenarios appear in UI immediately
3. **Consistent Theming** - Inherits the category's visual design
4. **Shared Learning Context** - Benefits from category's learning objectives and themes
5. **Minimal Code Changes** - Only need to add data, no structural changes

### Example: Quick Scenario Addition

For a minimal new scenario, you only need:

```javascript
// In categories.js - add to scenarios array (3 lines)
{
  id: 'quick-scenario',
  title: 'Quick Ethical Dilemma',
  difficulty: 'beginner'
}

// In [category]-scenarios.js - add scenario object (20-30 lines)
'quick-scenario': {
  title: 'Quick Ethical Dilemma',
  dilemma: '...',
  ethicalQuestion: '...',
  options: [/* 2-3 options with impacts */]
}
```

The scenario is immediately available platform-wide with full functionality!
