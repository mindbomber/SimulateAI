# Badge System Creation Prompt for Copilot Agents

## Context

You are creating badge progression systems for SimulateAI categories. Badges recognize learning
achievements and provide philosophical depth through meaningful quotes and reflections.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Badge Progression Structure

SimulateAI uses **triangular number progression** for badge requirements with **extensible tier
system**:

**Complete Triangular Progression:**

- **Tier 1:** 1 scenario (Explorer)
- **Tier 2:** 3 scenarios (Apprentice)
- **Tier 3:** 6 scenarios (Scholar)
- **Tier 4:** 10 scenarios (Philosopher)
- **Tier 5:** 15 scenarios (Master)
- **Tier 6:** 21 scenarios (Sage)
- **Tier 7:** 28 scenarios (Virtuoso)
- **Tier 8:** 36 scenarios (Legend)
- **Tier 9:** 45 scenarios (Cosmic)
- **Tier 10:** 55 scenarios (Divine)

**Formula:** Triangular number T(n) = n(n+1)/2

**Current Implementation:** The system currently implements 3 active tiers but is designed to scale
as content expands. The `MAX_IMPLEMENTED_TIER` configuration controls how many tiers are currently
active.

### 2. Badge Object Structure

**IMPORTANT**: Use this EXACT structure that matches the `badgeConfig` implementation in
`badge-modal.js`:

```javascript
{
  // Core badge properties (matches actual badge modal expectations)
  categoryEmoji: 'üöÉ',      // Main category visual identifier
  sidekickEmoji: '‚≠ê',      // Achievement tier indicator (category-specific)
  glowIntensity: 1,         // Visual tier (1-10, maps to GLOW_INTENSITY_CLASSES)
  title: 'The Trolley Explorer',
  quote: 'Every track leads to understanding.',
  categoryName: 'Trolley Problem',
  timestamp: '2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z'
}
```

### 2.1. Badge Naming Philosophy

**SimulateAI badges use UNIQUE, CATEGORY-SPECIFIC naming that combines domain metaphors with tier
progression:**

- **Not Generic:** Avoid generic "Explorer/Apprentice/Scholar" - these lack personality
- **Domain Metaphors:** Use imagery from the category (trolley tracks, black boxes, scales of
  justice)
- **Progressive Storytelling:** Show learning journey through metaphor evolution
- **Memorable Titles:** Each badge should feel special and earned, not formulaic

**Examples of Excellent Naming:**

- **Trolley Problem:** Ethics Explorer ‚Üí Junction Strategist ‚Üí Consequence Architect
- **AI Black Box:** Mystery Seeker ‚Üí Algorithm Investigator ‚Üí Transparency Champion
- **Automation Oversight:** Balance Finder ‚Üí Oversight Guardian ‚Üí Harmony Architect

**Naming Pattern Requirements:**

1. **Tier 1:** [Domain-Concept] [Discovery-Role] - Focus on initial exploration
2. **Tier 2:** [Domain-Concept] [Analysis-Role] - Focus on deeper investigation
3. **Tier 3:** [Domain-Concept] [Mastery-Role] - Focus on synthesis and expertise

**Implementation Notes:**

- The badge modal expects these exact field names
- `glowIntensity` maps to visual effects: 1-3=basic glow, 4-6=brilliant effects,
  7-10=legendary/cosmic effects
- Current maximum tier is configurable via `MAX_IMPLEMENTED_TIER`
- Confetti animations scale with tier level, with special finale effects for tiers 3+, 6+, and 9+
- Triangular progression ensures meaningful achievement gaps

### 3. Badge Tier System (Extensible Triangular Progression)

### 4. Philosophical Quote Selection

#### Quote Criteria

- **Category Relevance:** Must connect directly to the specific philosophical domain AND badge title
- **Tier Appropriate:** Complexity should match the achievement level (simple wisdom ‚Üí profound
  insights)
- **Unique per Badge:** Each badge should have its own thoughtful quote, not shared across
  categories

### 5. Badge Progression Design

#### Difficulty Scaling (3-Tier System)

#### Difficulty Scaling (Triangular Progression System)

- **Requirements increase** with each tier following triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28,
  36, 45, 55)
- **Visual effects intensify** progressively: basic glow (1-3) ‚Üí brilliant effects (4-6) ‚Üí
  legendary/cosmic effects (7-10)
- **Celebration animations** scale from basic confetti to epic finale with multiple waves and
  special effects
- **Philosophical depth grows** from introduction to divine understanding across 10 potential tiers

#### Motivational Elements

- **Clear milestones** with meaningful celebrations
- **Visual progression** through glow intensity and confetti effects
- **Philosophical depth** that provides intrinsic value
- **Achievement recognition** through the badge modal system

#### Tier Distribution (Scalable)

- **Tiers 1-3:** Currently active (basic progression)
- **Tiers 4-6:** Advanced achievements (brilliant to transcendent)
- **Tiers 7-10:** Elite mastery (legendary to divine)
- **Future Expansion:** System ready for additional tiers as content grows

### 6. Integration with Learning System

#### Badge Earning Process

1. **Scenario Completion:** Meet minimum score requirements
2. **Reflection Submission:** Demonstrate required depth
3. **Peer Engagement:** Fulfill social learning expectations
4. **System Validation:** Automated and human review
5. **Badge Award:** Celebration and recognition
6. **Progress Update:** Unlock next level or related badges

### 6. Implementation Requirements

#### Badge Modal Integration

The badge system must work with the existing `badge-modal.js` implementation:

- **Structure:** Uses exact `badgeConfig` property names (categoryEmoji, sidekickEmoji,
  glowIntensity, title, quote, categoryName, timestamp)
- **Visual Effects:** Leverages `GLOW_INTENSITY_CLASSES` for tier-appropriate glow effects
- **Confetti System:** js-confetti animations scale with tier level, special finale for tier 3
- **Shield Design:** Emojis positioned strategically in the visual shield layout

#### Learning Analytics

- **Time to Badge:** Track learning velocity across 3 tiers
- **Engagement Patterns:** Understand progression through triangular requirements
- **Reflection Quality:** Assess depth of understanding at each tier
- **Achievement Celebration:** Visual feedback through glow and confetti systems

### 7. Quality Standards

#### Philosophical Authenticity

- Quotes must be accurately attributed and contextualized
- Titles should reflect meaningful philosophical progression
- Quotes should provide genuine insights relevant to AI ethics
- Category connections should be substantive, not superficial

#### Educational Value

- Badges should motivate continued learning within each category
- Requirements should build from introduction (1) to mastery (6 scenarios)
- Recognition should feel earned through the celebratory modal system
- Progression should align with philosophical depth expectations

#### Technical Implementation

- Badge objects must use the exact structure expected by `badge-modal.js`
- Visual elements must map to extended glow intensity classes (1-10)
- Confetti effects automatically scale with tier level, with special finale thresholds at tiers 3+,
  6+, and 9+
- Timestamp format must be ISO string for proper storage/display
- System designed for extensibility as content expands beyond current 3-tier implementation

## Output Format

When creating badge systems, provide:

1. **Scalable tier progression** for the category (currently 1, 3, 6 scenarios, extensible to full
   triangular progression)
2. **Philosophical quotes** with clear relevance to AI ethics and appropriate depth for tier
3. **Proper emoji selection** for categoryEmoji and sidekickEmoji that scale with achievement level
4. **Correct glowIntensity mapping** (1-10 for full progression, currently 1-3 active)
5. **Badge object structure** matching badgeConfig implementation
6. **Future-ready design** that accounts for potential expansion to higher tiers
