### **1. Component Communication Interface**

The new systems provide enhanced component communication:

```javascript
// Unified Animation Usage
import UnifiedAnimationManager from "./core/unified-animation-manager.js";

// Works with both instance and static patterns
const manager = new UnifiedAnimationManager();
manager.animate(element, { opacity: 1 }, 300);

// Or static usage
UnifiedAnimationManager.animate(element, { opacity: 1 }, { duration: 300 });
```

```javascript
// Enhanced Modal Coordination
import {
  EnhancedModal,
  ModalUtility,
} from "./components/enhanced-modal-system.js";

// Stack-aware modal management
const modal1 = new EnhancedModal({ title: "First Modal" });
const modal2 = new EnhancedModal({ title: "Second Modal" });
modal1.open(); // Z-index: 1000
modal2.open(); // Z-index: 1010, properly stacked
```

### **2. Accessibility Integration**

Both systems now share consistent accessibility patterns:

- Screen reader announcements
- Reduced motion support
- Enhanced keyboard navigation
- Focus management coordination

### **3. Performance Coordination**

Systems now coordinate for better performance:

- Shared performance monitoring
- Coordinated cleanup cycles
- Unified error handling
- Memory management optimization

## **üõ†Ô∏è Migration Guide**

### **Animation System Migration**

**Existing code using `core/animation-manager.js`:**

```javascript
// OLD (still works via compatibility layer)
import AnimationManager from "./core/animation-manager.js";

// NEW (recommended)
import UnifiedAnimationManager from "./core/unified-animation-manager.js";
// OR use compatibility layer
import AnimationManager from "./core/animation-manager-compat.js";
```

**Existing code using `utils/animation-manager.js`:**

```javascript
// OLD (still works via compatibility layer)
import { AnimationManager } from "./utils/animation-manager.js";

// NEW (recommended)
