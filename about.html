            SimulateAI is an immersive educational platform designed to bring
            the complex world of artificial intelligence ethics to life. Our
            mission is to empower educators, students, researchers, and lifelong
            learners through open-ended, consequence-driven simulations that
            develop critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and systems awareness
            in an AI-driven world.

        <section class="about-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">üéì Our Educational Mission</h2>
          <p class="section-content">
            We believe that understanding AI ethics shouldn't be theoretical‚Äîit
            should be felt, questioned, and challenged through lived experience.
            SimulateAI turns abstract ethical dilemmas into interactive stories
            where users program, shape, and witness the consequences of
            AI-driven decisions.
          </p>
          <p class="section-content">
            Our simulations align with ISTE standards and other globally
            recognized educational frameworks, ensuring that teachers can
            integrate them confidently into classrooms with measurable,
            evidence-based outcomes. Each scenario includes built-in reflection
            tools, learning rubrics, and support materials for differentiated
            instruction.
