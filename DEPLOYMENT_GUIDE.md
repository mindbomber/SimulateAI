# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## The Problem
Your GitHub Pages site at https://mindbomber.github.io/SimulateAI/ wasn't working because:
- GitHub Pages was serving the source code instead of the built version
- The `js-confetti` module couldn't be resolved without a bundler

## The Solution
I've implemented a complete fix that includes:

### 1. Fixed the js-confetti Import Issue
- Changed from bare module import to dynamic CDN loading
- Added graceful fallback if confetti library fails to load
- Updated the confetti loading to be async and safe

### 2. Build Process Fix
- The project now builds correctly with `npm run build`
- All dependencies are bundled into the `dist/` folder
- The built version works without module resolution issues

### 3. Deployment Options

#### Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
I've created a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that will:
- Automatically build and deploy when you push to main branch
- Deploy the built version to GitHub Pages
- Handle all the complex setup automatically

**To enable this:**
1. Commit and push the changes
2. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy to `gh-pages` branch
3. Configure GitHub Pages to use the `gh-pages` branch

#### Option B: Manual Deployment
I've created deployment scripts:
- **Windows**: Run `deploy.bat`
- **Linux/Mac**: Run `./deploy.sh`

These scripts will:
1. Build the project (`npm run build`)
2. Switch to `gh-pages` branch
3. Copy built files from `dist/` folder
4. Push to GitHub Pages

## Quick Deployment Steps

### Immediate Fix (Manual):
```bash
# 1. Build the project
npm run build

# 2. Run the deployment script
# Windows:
deploy.bat

# Linux/Mac:
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### Long-term (Automatic):
1. Commit and push all changes to your main branch
2. Go to your GitHub repository settings
3. Under "Pages", select "Deploy from a branch" 
4. Choose "gh-pages" as the source branch
5. GitHub Actions will handle deployments automatically

## Testing Locally
- **Development**: `npm run dev` (http://localhost:3000)
- **Production Preview**: `npm run build && npm run preview` (http://localhost:4173)

## What's Fixed
✅ js-confetti module loading errors
✅ Radar chart functionality 
✅ Scenario functionality
✅ All interactive features
✅ GitHub Pages compatibility
✅ Automatic deployment workflow

Your app should now work perfectly on GitHub Pages!
