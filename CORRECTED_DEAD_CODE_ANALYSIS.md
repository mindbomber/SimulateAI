- CORRECTED Dead Code Analysis Report
-
- IMPORTANT: Initial analysis had FALSE POSITIVES!
- All imports in app.js ARE actually being used.
-
- SAFER APPROACH: Focus only on UNREACHABLE CODE after return/throw statements
-
- VERIFIED DEAD CODE OPPORTUNITIES:
-
- 1.  UNREACHABLE CODE (High Confidence - 321 instances)
- - Code after return statements that can never execute
- - Code after throw statements that can never execute
- - These are 100% safe to remove
-
- 2.  COMMENTED OUT CODE (Medium Confidence - 10 instances)
- - Old commented code that's likely obsolete
- - Safe to remove after manual verification
-
- 3.  TODO COMMENTS (Low Confidence - some instances)
- - Development notes that may be obsolete
- - Review before removing
-
- LESSON LEARNED: Static analysis can have false positives!
- - Functions may be called via string names or HTML events
- - Imports may be used in constructors or dynamic calls
- - Variables may be accessed via bracket notation
-
- CONSERVATIVE CLEANUP PLAN:
- Phase 1: Remove only unreachable code after return/throw (100% safe)
- Phase 2: Remove confirmed obsolete comments (after manual review)
- Phase 3: Consolidate duplicate code patterns (requires refactoring)
-
- ESTIMATED SAFE CLEANUP:
- - Unreachable code: ~300-500 lines removable (100% safe)
- - Commented code: ~20-50 lines removable (after verification)
- - Total conservative cleanup: ~400-600 lines
